  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: vector drift, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: vector drift, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: substrate gain, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: vector drift, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: ionic cascade, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: harmonic rise, pre-coherence bloom.
