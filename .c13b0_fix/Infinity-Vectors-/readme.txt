Neutrino Harp — Layered SVG Pack (modern neon style)

Order these layers top to bottom in Figma/After Effects:
1) divot_bloom.svg       (Screen/Add blend mode, 60–80%)
2) spin_arrows.svg       (Add/Linear Dodge, 80–100%)
3) signal_paths.svg      (Add/Linear Dodge, 90–100%)
4) grid.svg              (Normal, 100%)

Color key:
- Green (#38ef7d): Dang signal path A
- Blue  (#4bc0ff): Dang signal path B
- Red   (#ff4d6d): Spin flip arrows (up/down/side)
- Bloom (orange→gold): Divot resonance / cell-wall form

Animation suggestions (AE):
- Add "Trim Paths" to signal_paths to animate strokes along splines (2.5–3.5s).
- Pulse glow on spin_arrows with "Opacity" 0→100% easeOutExpo when signal passes a node.
- Scale up divot_bloom (1.0→1.25) with Gaussian blur increase at impact frame; then decay.
- Parallax: duplicate grid.svg, blur the back copy (5–8px) and offset slightly for depth.
